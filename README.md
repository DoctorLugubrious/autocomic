# Autocomic
This is a script that turns online comics into pdf's. Given a 'comic.json' file with a certain syntax, it can crawl and convert many different formats.

## Installation
Installation for this script is a pain. Internally, autocomic runs a python script which generates a 
LaTeX file which it compiles into a pdf. This has many efficiency and layout benefits (for example, 
if you modify the comic.json file and re-run the script, it can change the formatting of the pdf 
without having to re-download every comic). Unfortunately, this makes it pretty hard to install. 
You will need:

Python 3
 - requests
 - lxml
 - urllib
 - matplotlib
 - numpy
 - PIL

Rubber (LaTeX compiler)
 - graphicx
 - xcolor
 - pagecolor
 - fancyhdr
 - sectsty
 - tocloft

## Usage
Once you have all of the above working, you can generate a directory for a new comic with the command
        `generateComic comicName`
where comicName is the name of the directory that will be generated. Once the directory is generated, 
change it to the active directory (
      `cd comicName`
) and edit the 'comic.json' file with the editor of your choice (see details below). Once the file is
edited, run 
       `comic`
and the generation can begin. At any time, you can stop the process with SIGINT (^C on linux) and the script
will clean up after itself. Running
       `comic`
in that directory at any time will resume where the script left off, including if the script terminated
because it reached the last comic.

### comic.json 
comic.json contains the following variables:
 - name: name of the comic; will be on the first page of the pdf.
 - author: author of the comic
 - pageColor: rgb values of the color that the page will be (from 0-255)
 - textColor: color for titles and mouseover text
 - comicSelect: a valid css selector to grab the img tag of the comic (e.g. "#comic img")
 - titleSelect: a valid css selector for the title of the comic. If left empty, script will assume
that each strip/page does not have a title
 - mouseover: true will take the title text of each strip/page and write it beneath the comic.
 - nextSelect: a valid css selector for the link to the next comic (e.g. "a[rel='next']")
 - firstURL: the URL of the first page/strip
 - chapters: if set to true, generated pdf will have chapters
 - chapterElement: [optional] a valid css selector for the HTML element containing the chapter name. 
Used only if chapters is set to true
 - chapterRegex: [optional] a regex selecting the chapter name from the text of the element. If you want the entire
text, use ".*".
 - optionalHeight: [optional] some comics need a different page height. specify this as a value in pixels and the pages pf the generated pdf will be that height.

### cleanup
Running 
       `cleanupComic`
will delete all files generated by the script, leaving only the comic.json file. Useful if the images and
LaTeX files are not needed anymore or if something goes wrong.
